This plugin creates WordPress REST API endpoints for the MindBody API.

== Description ==

Need to work with a fitness company or gym and want to be able to interact with their [MindBody account](https://www.mindbodyonline.com "MINDBODY takes the work out of business.")? This plugin does just that for you, allowing you to work with the MindBody API seamlessly with the WordPress REST API.

With this plugin installed, you'll only need to create the code that implements MindBody into your application, rather than doing all the messy work of connecting, querying and verifying data.

PLEASE NOTE that this is not a complete solution for your application, merely the concatination of a lot of the setup work done by other developers.
